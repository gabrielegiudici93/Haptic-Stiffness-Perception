Robotic telemanipulation—the human-guided manipulation of remote objects—plays a pivotal role in several applications, from healthcare to operations in harsh environments. 
While visual feedback from cameras can provide valuable information to the human operator, haptic feedback is essential for accessing specific object properties that are difficult to be perceived by vision, such as stiffness.
For the first time, we present a participant study demonstrating
that operators can perceive the stiffness of remote objects during real-world telemanipulation with a dexterous robotic hand, when haptic feedback is generated from tactile sensing fingertips.
Participants were tasked with squeezing soft objects by teleoperating a robotic hand, using two methods of haptic feedback: 
one based solely on the measured contact force, while the second also includes the squeezing displacement between the leader and follower devices.
Our results demonstrate that operators are indeed capable of discriminating objects of different stiffness, relying on haptic feedback alone and without any visual feedback. Additionally, our findings suggest that the displacement feedback component 
may enhance discrimination with objects of similar stiffness.
